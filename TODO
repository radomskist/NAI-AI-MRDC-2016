Kinect general
	-Stop kinect from flooding logger

Kinect RGB
	-fit rgb image to depth image
	-Combine Saturation and Hue for floor detection
	-dynamic floor coloring (by getting average color of points)
	-Check path for obsticals
	-Check color of balls
	-Recognize key points
	-QR reading

Kinect depth
	-Check for a plane under long parallel horizontal lines
	-Check path for obsticals
	-Range finding request on points
	-Use blob detection to identify other robots?

Web camera
	-Ball color identification needs to be done
	-See where golf ball dispenser is

AI:
	-Look for posts on edge of map?
	-Fine path finding

SDL:

Laptop general:
	-Nvidia drives (check if openkinect needs anymore nvidia crap)
	-Fix opengl when opencv is online
	-Get power in cpp and temperature
	-Remount swap shit

Extras:
	-Make coarse path finding go diagnol when can
	-Make coarse path finding check which path is shortest
	-Make depth camera check if walls that fail are two walls and a gap
	-Generate ID# for path and map so it only updates when changed
