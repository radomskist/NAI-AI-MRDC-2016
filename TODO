NAI TODO:
General:
	-Need to build test course
	-Need colored balls (golf and soft ball)
	-Need to fix kinect lense
	-Make window that prints values
		+Battery
		+CPU temp
		+What drivemanager is doing
		+Any important info
		+Get power in cpp and temperature
	-Multithread
	-Move memory folder contents to infoproc

Kinect general
	-Stop kinect from flooding logger

Kinect RGB
	-Combine Saturation and Hue for floor detection
	-dynamic floor coloring (by getting average color of points)
		+cant see floor if too close to wall
	-Check path for obsticals
	-Check color of balls
	-Recognize key points
	-QR reading

Kinect depth
	-Check for a plane under long parallel horizontal lines
		+If plane is too high above horizon throw out
		+If line is horizontal and above horizon check it out (50% the distance it is above the horizon?)
	-Check path for obsticals
	-Range finding request on points
	-Use blob detection to identify other robots?

Web camera
	-Ball color identification needs to be done
	-See where golf ball dispenser is

AI:
	-Look for posts on edge of map?
	-Fine path finding
	-Fix bug with turning weird angles

SDL:
	-Fix crashing from mouse events
	-Optimize opengl window

Laptop general:
	-Nvidia drives (check if openkinect needs anymore nvidia crap)

Extras:
	-Double check rgb and depth allignment
	-Make coarse path finding go diagnol when can
	-Make coarse path finding check which path is shortest
	-Make depth camera check if walls that fail are two walls and a gap
	-Generate ID# for path and map so it only updates when changed
