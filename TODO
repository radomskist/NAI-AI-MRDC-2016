Being taken care of by other members:
	-Ball color identification needs to be done
	-QR reading

NAI TODO:
General:
	-Need to build test course
	-Need colored balls (golf and soft ball)
	-Need to fix kinect lense
	-Make window that prints values
		+Battery
		+CPU temp
		+What drivemanager is doing
		+Any important info
	-Fix crashing
	-Alternative to X forwarding
		+Way too slow to startup

Kinect
	-Save approx location of robot when images where taken?

Kinect RGB
	-Check color of balls

Kinect depth
	-Localizataion
		+remember where wall closest to center was last time it was seen.
	-Check for a plane under long parallel horizontal lines
		+If plane is too high above horizon throw out
		+If line is horizontal and above horizon check it out (50% the distance it is above the horizon?)
	-Check path for obsticals (if floor detection fails)

Web camera
	-See where golf ball dispenser is

AI:
	-Look for posts on edge of map?
	-Fine path finding
	-Keep track of how many times planes fail to verify and succeed

Extras:
	(kinect)
	-Double check rgb and depth allignment
	-Stop kinect from flooding logger
	-store found floor color and go off that
	(AI)
	-Make coarse path finding go diagnol when can
	-Make coarse path finding check which path is shortest
	(sdl)
	-Generate ID# for map so it only updates when changed
	-Optimize opengl window
		+Make sure no gl things are called when context isn't current
	(laptop)
	-Multithread
	-Nvidia drives (check if openkinect needs anymore nvidia crap)
	(Depth)
	-Make depth camera check if walls that fail are two walls and a gap
	-Use blob detection to identify other robots?
