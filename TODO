NAI TODO:
General:
	-Need to build test course
	-Need colored balls (golf and soft ball)
	-Need to fix kinect lense

Kinect general
	-Stop kinect from flooding logger

Kinect RGB
	-fit rgb image to depth image
	-Combine Saturation and Hue for floor detection
	-dynamic floor coloring (by getting average color of points)
	-Check path for obsticals
	-Check color of balls
	-Recognize key points
	-QR reading

Kinect depth
	-Make sure freeze frame still works
	-Check for a plane under long parallel horizontal lines
	-Check path for obsticals
	-Range finding request on points
	-Use blob detection to identify other robots?

Web camera
	-Ball color identification needs to be done
	-See where golf ball dispenser is

AI:
	-Look for posts on edge of map?
	-Fine path finding

SDL:
	-Fix crashing from mouse events

Arduino Laptop communication
	-Figure out what commands need to be done

Laptop general:
	-Find streaming software for display
		?VLC
	-Install OpenGL dependencies so processing isn't slow



Extras:
	-Make coarse path finding go diagnol when can
	-Make coarse path finding check which path is shortest
	-Make depth camera check if walls that fail are two walls and a gap
	-Generate ID# for path and map so it only updates when changed
