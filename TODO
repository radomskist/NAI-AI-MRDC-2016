THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE RIGHT AWAY:
Kinect RGB
	-This should get pretty decently developed asap

OpenGL context
	-Also asap, it will be needed for a lot of things
		+Kinect GL computations
		+Rendering the map (The reason we're not using OpenCV, also OpenCV is said to be slow on nvidia cards)

Arduino Laptop communication
	-Needed for issuing commands

Web camera
	-Not a priority, but should be easy to do for anyone who wants somewhere to start

Viewer on remote laptop
	-Not a priority, but we need to see what the robots doing when our main laptop is on the robot


THINGS THAT NEED SOMETHING FROM ABOVE DONE FIRST: 
Memory map
	+It's pretty much developed to the point where we need the kinect data to progress more, unless we use dummy objects

OpenGL 3d rendering of memory map
	+Needs OpenGL context
	-Will make pathfinding debugging really easy
	-Good to show off on the viewer

THINGS THAT CANT BE DONE FOR A WHILE:
Path finding
	+Can't be done until Kinect + Memory + Arduino is at a workable state, unless we use a map full of dummy objects which requires the opengl 3d rendering anyways
